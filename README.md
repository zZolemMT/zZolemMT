# About Me:
I am a high school student who loves programming.

# Languages I know:
As of right now, I don't know many programming languages, but I am trying to expand my knowledge. Here is a list of languages I do know:
- Python
- C
- Golang

# Projects
As for what I make, quite random, though I love game development.

Recently, I learned Golang, and am now learning Raylib with it.
